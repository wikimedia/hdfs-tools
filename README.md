# Wikimedia Foundation Hdfs Tools

This repository contains tools for HDFS we have written at WMF.


## HdfsRsync

This tool mimics standard rsync in copying/updating copies of folders between HDFS and a local
filesystem (both ways).

## HdfsArchiver
This tool is used to archive a file on hdfs while setting the specific permissions on the 
archived file.
